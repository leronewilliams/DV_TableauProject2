First the data was pulled using a join SQL query, then the two datasets were piped to ggplot to display the results. The RCurl and jsonlite package were loaded to allow general HTTP requests and process the results returned by the Web server.\n\n```{r}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nplot(cars)\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",
